## Setup and Data Import
If you haven't already, install the package using install.packages("ohtadstat")
```{r}
library(ohtadstats)
data(miyashita_langley_data)
summary(miyashita_langley_data)
```

## Computation of Ohta's D Statistics for a single Pair of Markers
```{r}
ohtadstat(index = c(28,41), data_set = miyashita_langley_data, tot_maf = 0.05, pop_maf = 0.01)
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
