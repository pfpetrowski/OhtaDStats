\title{Filtering datasets for subpopulations with low sample sizes}
\usage{
dfilter(data, minsample)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Matrix containing genotype data with individuals as rows and
loci as columns. Genotypes should be coded as 0 (homozygous), 1 (heterozygous),
or 2 (homozygous). Rownames must be subpopulation names and column names
should be marker names.}

\item{minsample}{An integer representing the smallest number of individuals a 
subpopulation must contain to be included in analysis.}
}
\value{
filtered_data The original dataset minus the subpopulations that fail
to meet the sample size threshold.
}
\description{
Simplifies the process of eliminating subpopulations with low sample sizes.
}
\examples{
test <- matrix(round(runif(400,1,2)), nrow = 100)
rownames(test) <- c(rep(c('A','B','C'),each=25), rep(c('D','E'), each=5), rep('F', 15))
dim(test)

filtered_test <- dfilter(test,12)	#The 'D' and 'E' subpopulations have only five members each and should be removed
dim(filtered_test)	# New dataset is reduced by 10 rows (five for 'D' and five for 'E')
