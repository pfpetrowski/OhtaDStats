\description{
This file is a matrix of genotypes from 96 chickens encompassing 5 breeds,
genotyped as part of the Synbreed Project. Individuals are in rows. Marker genotypes
are in columns, coded as 0, 1, and 2. Row names are a breed index so all rows named "1"
are from breed 1, all rows named "2" are from breed 2, and so on. Column names are
marker names. This data is a strict subset of the data which can be found at the 
source listed below.
